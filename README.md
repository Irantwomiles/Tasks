# Tasks

This is a basic TODO list desktop application created using electron.js and React.js with the boilerplate code provided by willjw3.

# How To

Clone the repository and npm install all of the packages in the root directory. Then after everything is installed you can run the program using the ```npm run start``` command or you can create a build using the ```npm run build``` which will create an executable that you can install.

# Functionalities

This is as basic as it gets, as this was just a project to refamiliarize myself with electron.js. All you can do right now is create a task for the day using the New button and select a date that you want to complete the task on. The task will then show up if the current day matches the date you selected. You can complete a task by clicking on it, or you can reverse it doing the same thing.
